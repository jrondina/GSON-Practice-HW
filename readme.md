> ***Note:*** _This can be done individually or in pairs_

## Exercise

For this homework, you are going to use GSON to parse some JSON data received from an API into objects. You will then use those objects to update the UI so the user can see the data.

Explore the [Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory), find an API (either pure REST or an API-backed SDK), and get data from it. Finally, create the necessary classes, parse the data using GSON, and display the data in a way that's meaningful (e.g. a list of items in a ListView or RecyclerView; one item w/ detail in a series of TextViews and/or ImageViews - whatever makes sense for the data you're getting).

#### Requirements

- Use GSON to parse JSON data retrieved from an API
- Show the data on the screen in a reasonable manner
- Restriction: You ***cannot*** use the Walmart API, since we already used that in the lesson

**Bonus:**
- Use an API that requires authentication via OAuth

#### Deliverable

Create a new project in Android Studio, build your app to meet the requirements, and submit a pull request.

If you work with a partner, only one person needs to submit a pull request, but _**please list both names in your pull request title!**_
